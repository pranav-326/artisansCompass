1.  **Create an Account or Log In:**
    *   If you're a new user, click "Sign Up" and provide your name, a short bio, your email, and a password. Your bio will help personalize the stories generated for your products.
    *   If you already have an account, enter your email and password to log in.

2.  **Upload Your Product Image:**
    *   Once logged in, drag and drop an image of your product or click to select a file. A preview will appear.

3.  **Provide Product Details:**
    *   In the "Product Details (for story)" box, write a description of your product.
    *   Include key details like materials, crafting process, or what makes it unique. This will be used to create your product's story. For example: "Hand-carved wooden bowl, made from reclaimed maple wood. It has a smooth, satin finish and is perfect for salads or as a decorative centerpiece."

4.  **Define Your Audience:**
    *   Enter your specific target audience to help tailor the tone of the story and images. For example: "Eco-conscious home decorators".

5.  **Choose Your Output:**
    *   Use the "Generate Professional Images" toggle switch to decide your output.
    *   **Keep it on (default):** To generate both a story and three AI-powered professional product photos. If you choose this option, you must also describe your "Desired Photo Aesthetic/Vibe" in the box that appears (e.g., "On a marble countertop with flowers in the background").
    *   **Turn it off:** If you only want to generate a captivating story for your product.

6.  **Create Your Content:**
    *   Once you have filled in all the required fields, click the "Create Story & Showcase" or "Create Story" button.
    *   The app will generate your content and display it on a new results page. This may take a few moments.

7.  **View and Use Your Showcase:**
    *   On the results page, you will see your generated content.
    *   If you generated images, a carousel will be displayed.
    *   Your product story will be shown alongside the images.
    *   Click the "Copy Story" button to easily copy the text for your product listings, social media, and more.

8.  **Refine Your Images:**
    *   If you generated images, you can click the "Regenerate Images" button to get a new set of photos based on your original prompt, without changing the story.

9.  **Start a New Project:**
    *   Click "Create New Story" to return to the main screen and start over with a blank form.
